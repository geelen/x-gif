_The GIF tag the internet deserves_

## Usage

**&lt;x-gif&gt;** is a web component for flexible GIF playback. Speed them up, slow them down, play them in reverse, synch multiple beats to a rhythm, synch them to audio, whatever you like.

1. Import Polymer
  ```html
  <script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script>
  ```

2. Import X-Gif
  ```html
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/x-gif/dist/x-gif.html">
  ```

3. Enjoy limitless GIF possibilities
  ```html
  <x-gif src="probably_cats.gif"></x-gif>
  ```

What does it do?

* AJAX fetches the GIF as a binary stream
* Slices the GIF into frames like a total boss
* Stacks the frames one on top of the other
* Starts a `requestAnimationFrame` loop to play back the gif at its natural frame rate

**[Here's a demo! It just might work in your browser!](http://geelen.github.io/x-gif)**

## Options

### Speed

Spins through the frames at its natural rate multiplied by `speed`

```html
<x-gif src="definitely_cats.gif" speed="2.1"></x-gif>
```

### Bpm

Breaks the GIF across 1 or more _beats_ (depending on how long the GIF is), where each beat is 1/`bpm` minutes long.

```html
<x-gif src="something_dumb_from_buzzfeed.gif" bpm="120"></x-gif>
```

### Hard-bpm

Just like `bpm` but locks all GIFs to one _beat_, regardless of how long they were originally.

```html
<x-gif src="something_dumb_from_buzzfeed.gif" hard-bpm="120"></x-gif>
```

### Stopped

```html
<x-gif src="something_rad_off_reddit.gif" stopped></x-gif>
```

Stops the `requestAnimationFrame` loop inside the GIF. You can add or remove the `stopped` attribute and it will stop or start. Obvs.

### Sync

```html
<x-gif src="mr_t_works_it.gif" sync></x-gif>
```

Defers playback to an external clock, such as beat data from an audio stream to make rad synchronised GIFs & music. [See an example](http://geelen.github.io/x-gif/demos/audio.html).
